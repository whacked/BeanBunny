assorted python files to interface with assorted file formats

* BeanBunny.io.FeatConf

  simple reader for .fsf files to replace repeated =grep=ing

  works as a module and from command line:

  - python -mBeanBunny.io.FeatConf -i design.fsf # lists feat_files
  - python -mBeanBunny.io.FeatConf -c design.fsf # lists contrasts
  - python -mBeanBunny.io.FeatConf -p design.fsf # should output the same as cat design.fsf, to test equivalence

** caveats

   it's dumb in that quoted strings don't get quote-stripped

* BeanBunny.io.DicomInfo

  simple class to hold dicom run information, mostly for nipy use

* BeanBunny.io.XOJFile

  xournal 0.4.5 file writer?

* BeanBunny.io.JAJFile

  Jarnal (.jaj) file extractor

  used with XOJFile in jaj2xoj converter
